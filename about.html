                My work is primarily focused on Japanese aesthetics, particularly manga and anime, as well as ink and

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My work is primarily focused on Japanese aesthetics, particularly manga and anime, as well as ink and
                watercolor techniques. I employ both traditional and digital methods, utilizing tools such as Photoshop,
                Clip Studio, and Illustrator.</p>
            <p>My name is Jonathan Lara (H. Batto), from Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.</p>

            <p>After studying Film and Show Production in Las Palmas, I moved to Madrid to complete my studies in
                Photography for Film and TV, as well as a Master’s Degree in Screenwriting at TAI School (Rey Juan
                Carlos University).</p>

            <p>After some time working in television and production companies, I traveled to Japan, where I ended up
                studying Manga at Aichi Zoukei Design College (あいち造形デザイン専門学校).</p>

            <p>After the pandemic, I returned to Las Palmas, where I now publish online — both on Webtoon (in English
                and Spanish) and on DAYS NEO (in Japanese). As a screenwriter, I’ve published the graphic novel “Sesión
                de Tarde” (La Cúpula, 2016), together with Stephen Hausdorff, and the webcomic “Guionista & Dibujante”,
                alongside artist Paih.</p>

            <p>I would describe my style as classic manga, and I’m striving to make myself known as a comic creator,
                which is what I truly want to do.</p>
